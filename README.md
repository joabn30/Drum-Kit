This is a simple and interactive web application that I designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site features a virtual drum kit that allows users to either click on drum buttons or press specific keys on their keyboard to trigger corresponding drum sounds.
JavaScript event listeners and objects are used to map each interaction to its respective audio file, providing a fun and responsive user experience.
